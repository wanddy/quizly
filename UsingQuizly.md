## Introduction ##

In standalone mode, the [Quizly](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly/) app presents App Inventor live coding exercises to the user.  The user creates a solution and presses the _Submit_ button to receive feedback on whether on the solution. Wrong answers can be retried as many times as necessary.  The user can switch to a different quiz at any time.

## Select a Quiz ##

Quizzes are listed in a drop-down menu.  When the user selects the quiz, the workspace will be configured for that problem and the user will be presented with the question.

## Using the Workspace ##

The workspace is a scaled down version of the App Inventor workspace. The quiz maker determines which types of blocks should be available on the workspace menu. So not all blocks and components are presented.

The workspace works just as it does in App Inventor.

## Getting Hints ##

The quiz may come with 0 or more hints.  Click the _Hint_ button to display one at a time.

## Submitting the Solution ##

When the user clicks the _Submit_ button the app will evaluate the solution reporting whether it is correct or not.
