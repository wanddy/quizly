Quizly is a live coding platform for [App Inventor for Android](http://appinventor.mit.edu) based on [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/).  For example:

## Downloads ##

Downloads are now stored on Google drive:

  * [Development version](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B2IG3uhfSus-N1FxSGdJYTlDRGM) -- all source code and libraries.
  * [Embeddable version](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B2IG3uhfSus-N1FxSGdJYTlDRGM) -- code needed for deployment.

## Demos ##
Two separate applications are used of making and taking quizzes.  Quiz Maker generates a JSON object that can be uploaded (manually, for now) into Quizly:

  * [Example Quiz Maker](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly/makequiz.html) ([directions](UsingMakequiz.md))
  * [Example Quizzes](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly)  ([directions](UsingQuizly.md))

Quizly is self-contained and can easily be plugged into existing web sites and web applications, for example App Inventor course sites.
  * [Quizly embedded into online App Inventor lesson](http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/mobilecsp)  ([how it works](EmbeddingInAWebApp.md))
  * [Quizly embedded in Google Coursebuilder](http://appinventor102.appspot.com) -- See Activity 4.1 and 6.1

The code is free and open source -- and there is much work to do!
